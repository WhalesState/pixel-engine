Convection Texture Tools are an enhanced fork of Microsoft's DirectX Texture Library (DirectXTex).

All of the CPU codecs have been replaced with new SIMD-optimized codecs that get great quality and great speed.

See the "ConvectionKernels" dir for stand-alone codecs if you want to use them outside of the library.
