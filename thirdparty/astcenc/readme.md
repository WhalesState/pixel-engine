# About

The Arm速 Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) Encoder, `astcenc`, is
a command-line tool for compressing and decompressing images using the ASTC 
texture compression standard.

## The ASTC format

The ASTC compressed data format, developed by Arm速 and AMD, has been adopted as
an official extension to the OpenGL速, OpenGL ES, and Vulkan速 graphics APIs. It
provides a major step forward in terms of both the image quality at a given
bitrate, and the format and bitrate flexibility available to content creators.
This allows more assets to use compression, often at a reduced bitrate compared
to other formats, reducing memory storage and bandwidth requirements.
