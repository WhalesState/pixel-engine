> **Warning**
>
> The UWP platform port is not currently in a working state for the `master`
> branch, and may be dropped in the future.

This folder contains the C++ code for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
platform port. **This is not to be confused with the "standard" Win32 port**,
which is available in [`platform/windows`](/platform/windows).

See also [`misc/dist/uwp_template`](/misc/dist/uwp_template) folder for the UWP
project template used for packaging the UWP export templates.
